# String_Matching_Algorithms

Has 4 algorithms.

Rabin Karp is implemented using the java inbuilt hash function. Therefore, almost no spurious hits.

Created all of them for the SCS2201 String matching Assignment.

All except boyer-moore-horspool have wrong logic with respect to counting the matches . (They only count the lines, not every match)
